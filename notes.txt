Remember that other project I mentioned, to add some JS flourish to some membership pages?

 

Here’s the link to the WIP

https://electoral-reform.netdonor.net/page/73434/donate/1?mode=DEMO

 

Would you have time first half of next week to work on this?

 

So what we need to happen is:

 

-          CLICK Quick read - Aims and Objectives > Bring up overlay with the text and ‘agree’ button as per the mock up **DONE

-          CLICK  'I agree' - overlay disappears and the checkbox appears on the form and is checked. **DONE 'Quick read' button disappears.**DONE

-          First subhead (Membership amount) becomes active – form block underneath become visible, heading has pink background **DONE

-          On click of 'next step' the next heading (payment details) becomes active with contents beneath **DONE. Heading above collapses (stays pink) and now works like an accordion (user can expand/minimise)

-          On click of 'last step' same happens again to this form block.

 

Each form block beneath their respective headings has a unique class. They are:

 

-          amountForm

-          aboutForm

-          payForm

 

And each subheading block has its own unique class:

 

-          amountSubhead

-          youSubhead

-          paySubhead

 

I have attached the mock up to show some of the actions here. Any thoughts/questions? If you have time early next week we can get this one finished and signed off pretty quick J
